| Milestones   |
| ------------ |
| **1st Milestone (T4G profile sign up)**: Pretty much like Classified Ads. Anyone can sign up but only the ones who passed the T4G criteria will be published, by default profiles are hidden to public. However, we may need to be creative on the details to be published, perhaps consider reviews, stars, what the community says but as a start just the basics. For the time being, we can start putting the usual stuff (similar to LinkedIn but cut down version). 1st Milestone is pretty much what we will try to statically publish on our existing website (and IMS website) as an interim while waiting for the app. |
| ** 2nd Milestone (Non-Profit/Charity sign up)**: By default, published profile will not expose all details to public. However, serious help seekers can sign up to T4G to see more details about the potential candidate.  |
